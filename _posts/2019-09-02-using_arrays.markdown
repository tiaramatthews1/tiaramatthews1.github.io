An array is like a basket––it is a container for a collection of data.

In this lesson I have learned how to create arrays, add data to arrays, remove data from arrays and retrieve data from arrays.

I have also learned to Create a new array that contains data as well as a new array that is empty. I can also add an element to the end of an array. Continued, I have added an element to the front of an array, removed an element from the front of an array, remove an element from the end of an array, and lastly retrieved data from a specific array index.
