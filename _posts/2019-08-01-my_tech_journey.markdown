            My name is Tiara Matthews. I am a 23 year old college drop out. I have been working in fast food and customer service for over 5 years now. I found out about Flatiron School through Career Karma which I came across while scrolling through instagram. I did a little research because I knew nothing about coding or how it works or what it is used for.  Today is week three of my cohort. I decided to learn software deveIopment for a better education and job within this field that will help me build better skills and knowledge of the way technology functions and how it will change and impact our lives and the world in the future. I am currently working on object orientation labs. Everything has been very informative so far and cant wait to go out into the world with the knowledge to build a better future for myself and also for others who have less opportunities.
